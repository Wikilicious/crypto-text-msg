# crypto-text-msg
Protocol for communicating in a game-theory dominated world.


# Guiding Ideas
- Everything has a cost.
- How can these costs be covered.


# Situation Thoughts
- Costs must be covered and come from a few key mechanisms
  - User data - privacy level is an arbitrary line between marketing, legal, and factual.
  - User payments/subscriptions - unpopular; sure, yet no one works for free.
  - Full privacy and free to use.
    - Sounds perfect. Short term, yes. Long term... they are cost-advantage destroying competition to then use the above options.
- Everything will resort to Game Theory
  - Text msg became free... spam pervailed
